<div id="a2">What Is Active Component ?</div>
 
<p id="p1"> An active component is a device that has an analog electronic filter with the ability to amplify a signal or produce a power gain. There are two types of active components: electron tubes and semiconductors or solid-state devices. A typical active component would be an oscillator, transistor or integrated circuit.

    An active component works as an alternating-current circuit in a device, which works to increase the active power, voltage or current. An active component is able to do this because it is powered by a source of electricity that is separate from the electrical signal.
 </p>
<div id="a3">What Is Passive Component ?</div>

<p id="p2"> A passive component is a module that does not require energy to operate, except for the available alternating current (AC) circuit that it is connected to. A passive module is not capable of power gain and is not a source of energy. A typical passive component would be a chassis, inductor, resistor, transformer, or capacitor.

    Generally, passive components are not able to increase the power of a signal nor are they able to amplify it. However, they can increase current or voltage by an LC circuit that stores electrical energy from resonant frequencies or by a transformer that acts like an electrical isolator.

<p id="p3"> A transistor is a miniature semiconductor that regulates or controls current or voltage flow in addition amplifying and generating these electrical signals and acting as a switch/gate for them. Typically, transistors consist of three layers, or terminals, of a semiconductor material, each of which can carry a current.

<p id="p4">An amplifier is an electronic device that increases the voltage, current, or power of a signal. Amplifiers are used in wireless communications and broadcasting, and in audio equipment of all kinds. They can be categorized as either weak-signal amplifiers or power amplifiers.

<p id="p5">Logic gates are an important concept if you are studying electronics. These are important digital devices that are mainly based on the Boolean function. Logic gates are used to carry out logical operations on single or multiple binary inputs and give one binary output. In simple terms, logic gates are the electronic circuits in a digital system.

<p id="p7"> A capacitor is a two-terminal electrical device that can store energy in the form of an electric charge. It consists of two electrical conductors that are separated by a distance. The space between the conductors may be filled by vacuum or with an insulating material known as a dielectric.

<p id="p8"> An electrical sensor (also called an electronic sensor) is a device that detects a physical parameter of interest (e.g. heat, light, sound) and converts it into electrical signal that can be measured and used by an electrical or electronic system.

<p id="p9"> An inductor, also called a coil, choke, or reactor, is a passive two-terminal electrical component that stores energy in a magnetic field when electric current flows through it. An inductor typically consists of an insulated wire wound into a coil.

    When the current flowing through the coil changes, the time-varying magnetic field induces an electromotive force (emf) (voltage) in the conductor, described by Faraday's law of induction. According to Lenz's law, the induced voltage has a polarity (direction) which opposes the change in current that created it. As a result, inductors oppose any changes in current through them.
